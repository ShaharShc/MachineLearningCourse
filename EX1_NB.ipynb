Use the [sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB.html) implementation (see the [source code for sklearn.naive_bayes](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/naive_bayes.py) for details).\n",

Set this value to $0$ (this is the default), which in this case would mean every pixel with non-zero value will be set to 1.\n",

        "1. Plot the mean image of each class (estimated $\\hat{p}_{ji}$) and generate one sample of each class (remember, you can do this since this is a generative model). You will need to access the `feature_log_prob_` attribute of the trained model.\n",

Plot the confusion matrix of your classifier, as claculated on the test data (it is recommended to use [sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)). Calculate the total accuracy (fraction of correctly classified images), and summarize the results in your own words.\n",
